       <p>Hi, I'm Jonah Byrne. I'm a violin teacher and performer who has lived in Seattle for the past fifteen years. I'm also an aspiring web developer!</p>
       <p>As a violinist I've played in a wide variety of bands around Seattle, touring with post-rock and experimental bands, and more recently with old-school country bands. I've also had the opportunity to play live with some national acts like the Breeders and Jamie Wyatt.</p>
       <p>As a web developer I've got a lot to learn, but I'm excited to be learning it. I think I'm interested in more of the programming side of web development, but I'm still figuring it out. This is my second-ever webpage!</p>
